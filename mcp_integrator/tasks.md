# Hydra Task Management: MCP Integration Agent

## Overview
The MCP Integration Agent is responsible for discovering, indexing, and integrating MCP servers from various registries wherever they can help. Its purpose is to provide the best available tools and protocols to other Hydra agents. For now, the agent will operate on demand, with a plan to scale to at least daily checks as the system matures.

Each Hydra agent is designed to work with a maximum of 5 MCPs. Selection will be based on criteria including precision fit, reliability, schema clarity, and overall performance.

## Active Work

### Code Reorganization and Structure Improvement
- **Description:** Reorganize the codebase for better maintainability, testability, and scalability
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Date Added:** 2023-07-01
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] **Create New Package Structure:**
    - [x] Implement the following directory structure:
      ```
      mcp_integrator/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── cli/            # Command-line interfaces
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   ├── mcp_finder_cli.py
        │   └── stack_recommender_cli.py
        ├── core/           # Core finder functionality
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   └── finder.py
        ├── task/           # Task analysis and decomposition
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   ├── analyzer.py
        │   └── decomposer.py
        ├── query/          # Query generation and processing
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   ├── generator.py
        │   ├── clarifier.py
        │   ├── cache.py
        │   └── models.py
        ├── solution/       # Solution recommendation and explanation
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   ├── recommender.py
        │   └── explainer.py 
        └── utils/          # Utility functions and interfaces
            ├── __init__.py
            ├── context.py
            └── interface.py # Note: interface.py from original structure needs creation/review
      ```
    - [x] Create proper `__init__.py` files with appropriate imports (and fixed encoding)
    - [x] Update import statements across all modules
    - [x] Create setup.py for package installation
    - [x] Add missing `solution/explainer.py` file

  - [x] **Split Large Modules:** (Initial refactoring done, further refinement possible)
    - [x] Refactor `mcp_stack_recommender.py` into `solution/recommender.py` and `cli/stack_recommender_cli.py`
    - [x] Refactor `mcp_query_models.py` into `query/models.py`
    - [x] Refactor `smart_decomposer.py` into `task/decomposer.py`
    - [x] Refactor `solution_explainer.py` into `solution/explainer.py`
    - Note: File length constraints will be monitored going forward.

  - [x] **Standardize Naming Conventions:**
    - [x] Resolve duplicate MCP finder files (`mcp-finder.py` -> `cli/mcp_finder_cli.py` and `mcp_finder.py` -> `core/finder.py`)
    - [x] Ensure consistent use of underscores in file names
    - [x] Standardize function and variable naming conventions (Ongoing check)
    - [x] Update docstrings to follow Google style (Ongoing check)

  - **Progress:**
    - All original modules have been moved to the new package structure.
    - Import statements updated.
    - Encoding issues in `__init__.py` and other `.py` files resolved.
    - Missing `solution/explainer.py` added.
    - Package is installable and runnable.

  - **Next Steps:**
    - Create/Review `utils/interface.py` (renamed from `integration_interface.py`)
    - Implement comprehensive tests for all modules.
    - Enhance documentation (README, usage examples, component docs).
