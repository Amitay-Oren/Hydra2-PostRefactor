# Hydra Planning Document

## 1. Vision

Hydra is an always-on orchestration system built to eliminate complexity and scale execution across every domain.  
It is a modular swarm of autonomous agents that continuously ideate, develop, test, and iterate—without human intervention.

Hydra is not an assistant. It is a distributed execution engine that adapts, evolves, and builds your vision autonomously.

Hydra is designed to channel global intelligence—scanning GitHub, whitepapers, APIs, research labs, developer communities, and tool registries.  
It does not merely consume insights—it **absorbs frameworks**, **implements protocols**, and **copies operational excellence** from anywhere in the world.  
This system turns the best ideas of others into working, integrated, real-time execution flows.

## 2. Core Objectives

- **Remove Bottlenecks**: Eliminate the human operator as a limiting factor.  
- **Self-Upgrade**: Continuously discover, evaluate, and integrate new tools.  
- **Autonomous Execution**: Agents iterate and improve without external triggers.  
- **Seamless Integration**: Connect with APIs, business tools, and dev environments.  
- **Adapt to Change**: Stay relevant even when existing protocols are deprecated.  
- **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Minimize the need for user oversight.  
- **Channel Global Wisdom**: Constantly ingest and operationalize the world's best ideas, tactics, and standards.

## 3. System Architecture

### Team Leader Agent
- Interfaces with the user.
- Sets strategic priorities and goals.
- Delegates tasks to specialized agents.
- Aggregates updates and reports.

### Stack Researcher Agent
- Scans open-source ecosystems, academic work, industry protocols, and tooling directories.
- Tracks frameworks, libraries, and best practices from across domains.
- Pushes continuous updates into Hydra’s execution stack.

### MCP Agent Interface
- Connects to MCP servers across registries.
- Discovers tools, APIs, prompts, and datasets.
- Active registries include:
  - Smithery
  - Composio
  - Glama
  - MCP.so
  - Pulse MCP

### Execution Agents
- Handle development, design, operations, marketing, and finance.
- Can spawn micro-agents for hyper-specialized subtasks.
- Operate on a continuous feedback loop.

### Roundtable Engine
- Gathers relevant agents for decision simulations.
- Returns ranked options with rationale.
- Optimized for strategic operations, hiring, pricing, product, and more.

### Tool Router
- Dynamically assigns tools or APIs to agent workflows.
- Spawns subprocesses with stdio, WebSocket, or REST protocols.
- Matches tools to agent needs automatically.

### Hydra War Room
- Real-time interface and dashboard.
- Visualizes agent activity, decision trees, and project status.
- Central command for execution monitoring.

## 4. Technology Stack

### Languages
- **Python**: Core agent logic and orchestration.  
- **TypeScript**: Frontend and SDKs.  
- **Shell & Docker**: Infra automation and deployment.

### Frameworks & Tools
- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent collaboration and orchestration.  
- **AutoGen**: Execution, debugging, and conversational agents.  
- **LangGraph / LangChain**: Workflow control and memory.  
- **n8n**: Visual automation (embedded in agents).  
- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: Native multi-tool orchestration.  
- **Smithery Registry API**: MCP discovery and integration.

## 5. MCP Integration

Hydra uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to interface with a global library of standardized tools, prompts, and resources.

### MCP Resource Types
- **Tools**: Functions and APIs.  
- **Resources**: Files, databases, structured content.  
- **Prompts**: Domain-specific instruction templates.

### Hydra’s Evaluation Criteria
- Deployment stability  
- API schema clarity  
- Tool diversity  
- Registry uptime  
- Failure handling

Hydra continuously discovers and integrates new MCP servers.

## 6. System Constraints

- **Cloud-Preferred**: Favor managed and hosted services.  
- **Prebuilt-First**: Use off-the-shelf tools before custom coding.  
- **Async-Centric**: Minimize latency by defaulting to async ops.  
- **Fully Autonomous**: Agents should not rely on human input.  
- **Traceable**: All outputs include context, logs, and reasoning.  
- **Protocol-Agnostic**: Able to swap tools as protocols evolve.

---

## 7. Operating Principles

- **Speed Over Perfection**: Launch fast, iterate aggressively.  
- **Multiply Instead of Delegate**: Automate tasks, don’t assign them manually.  
- **Test 100, Ship 1**: Generate and filter massive option sets.  
- **No Ego**: Agents optimize for outcomes, not human control.  
- **Zero Bottlenecks**: Design Hydra to move without user delays.

---

## 8. MVP Milestones

- **Team Leader Integration**: Connect Team Leader, Stack Researcher, and Execution Agents.  
- **MCP Agent Prototype**: Implement auto-discovery of MCP servers across registries.  
- **Tool Router Build**: Deploy tool-router capable of dynamic subprocess spawning.  
- **War Room Dashboard**: Launch real-time interface for agent and venture monitoring.  
- **Roundtable Engine**: Operationalize multi-agent strategic decision simulations.  
- **Persistent Logging**: Establish system-wide traceability and logs.
